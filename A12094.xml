         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Heretofore Chriſtians were taught that holy Scriptures expounded by the Vniuerſall and Generall voice of the Church, were the rule of faith, and accordingly all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this rule, they were called Catholikes: but this rule being left by Popes, and the infallibility being giuen to them by their followers; thereupon worthily of Popes, the heads of their faith, they haue beene, and are called Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians and Papiſts.

I haue beene very large, (courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) in producing many inſtances, to ſhew that rule of theirs to be vaine, vpon which their traditions are built, to wit, that whatſoeuer the Romane Church generally obſcrueth, whereof no beginning can be ſhewed, that muſt needs be a tradition Apoſtolical, infinite like inſtances might be made, yea and moſt iuſtly and ſoundly in all ſuch rites, lawes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and articles of faith, which they teach contrary to the true reformed Churches.

And ſo to conclude theſe my Motiues about their idle rules of faith, the Chriſtian Reader, who is carefull of his owne ſaluation, and giueth obedient eare to that propheticall light of Gods ſacred Scriptures, (expounded by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church) which Scriptures Saint <hi>Peter</hi>

For the myſtery of the Maſſe, is one of the gainefulleſt traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, they doe vſe: as in like ſort, not a little profitable is the adoration, and worſhipping of images, which cauſeth ſuch a confluence of gifts at <hi>Loretto, noſtre Dame de Hall,</hi> and at <hi>Sichem</hi> &amp;c. A great inducement, doubtleſſe, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to vphold with their vtmoſt power ſuch like worſhips, both there and in many other places. When I my ſelfe was laſt at <hi>Sichem,</hi> ſome yeere ſince, I was with my admiration informed by a Reuerend Prieſt of that place, that there was very ſmall credit to be giuen to the wonders, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of that Image; before which I ſaw ſuch adorations, proſtrations, inuocations, that as in ſome I ſuſpected ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, ſo in others I lamented their indiſcreetly zealous ignorance, and many their vnprofitable offerings.

                     <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> (afterwards called <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond Pope) deliuereth in his Commentaries, how the Florentines, with other People there abouts doe (<hi>mira religione venerari eam imaginem</hi>) with wonderfull religion, worſhip that Image, eſteeming the ſame, (<hi>beneficam pluuiae donatricem</hi>) the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and bountifull giuer of raine; and therefore many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pilgrimages, are made vnto it, by thoſe ſuperſtitious people, to the great profite of the Prieſts of that place. If
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1880:54"/> I had not ſeene theſe things I ſhould haue hardly beleeued this Pope reporting them.</p>
                  <p>Not many yeeres ſince, there was a certaine peece of wood, of the tree, where the Image of <hi>Sichem</hi> ſtood, which being framed into a picture, and repreſenting the image of <hi>Sichem,</hi> was at Saint <hi>Omers</hi> by the Biſhop of that City, ſuperſtitiouſly dedicated and ſet vp to bee adored in the French Ignatians Church, with ſuch often incenſings, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, bowings, proſtratings, lifting vp of hands, that truly it might iuſtly be meruailed, how Gods vengeance, did not fall vpon ſuch impudent Idolaters, or the earth not open &amp; ſwallow them vp: but great was the commodity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which thereby redounded to the Ignatians: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rather ſuch contemptible creatures may and ought to bee honoured with diuine worſhip, though they haue neither tradition, Scripture, nor Ancient Father to iuſtifie their proceeding herein. The Clerke of a poore Church,<note place="margin">A pretty prank of a Saint O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Clark.</note> in that City obſeruing, what immenſe profite, came to the Ignatians there by, to bring ſome commodity to his poore neglected Church, deuiſeth a prety pranke for that purpoſe. He cunningly and ſecretly remoueth a picture of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, from an obſcure place, in which it ſtood, into a more eminent, and principall place of the ſame Church, making and giuing out, as though the bleſſed Virgins pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, diſcontented with her former ſtanding, had remoued it ſelfe, to a place, fitter for adoration, and worſhip. This picture was by ſome ſuperſtitious people preſently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and frequented, and the miracle by the Biſhop and the Ignatians alſo defended as probable; conſidering, ſaid the wiſe men of <hi>S. Omers,</hi> the dayly wondrous operations of the Images at <hi>Sichem,</hi> and <hi>Loretto:</hi> but the Eſtcheuines, and Magiſtrates of the Citie, ſuſpecting ſome legerdemaine, very ſhortly by great diligence found the knauery, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſerts, cauſed the vilanous Clerke to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But heere I obſerue how eaſily the ſuperſtitious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Ignatians, might haue beene ſeduced, and how
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1880:54"/> credulous they are in ſuch things. Like credulity, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued certain yeers ſince, in the learned and Peereleſſe V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie of Doway, where in a certaine ſmall and poore Chappell, was the picture of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as lying in Childebedde after trauaile (ſuch foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were permitted in that famous Vniuerſity) the which alſo, was with a linnen veile couered, as the faſhion is for women lying in Childbed: this image, vpon a certain time to ſome deuout and ſimple women which came to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for happy deliuerance, ſeemed to moue, and ſtirre it ſelfe: the report whereof, flew vp and downe the City, as if the Virgin her ſelfe had beene come downe to lye in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againe. This report cauſed admiration, amongſt the Dowiſts: admiration, cauſed great deuotion; deuotion, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation to the picture: frequentation a neceſſary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to remoue the picture, and to place it in ſome more capable Church or Chappell: the remoouall wherof, being attempted; thoſe Maſons who went about it, inſteed of the Mother of Clemency, and Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> felt the wrathfull vengeance of the iuſt Iudge; for one of them was with ſtones that fell downe vpon him, preſently ſlaine, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wounded, and the third very hardly eſcaped. <hi>Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t a paucorum, exempla ſunt omnium,</hi> the Torments of a few are examples for many. But <note n="a" place="margin">2. ad Corin. 2.</note> the God of this world hath ſo blinded the eies of theſe men, that ſeeing theſe things, they ſee them not, but ſtill moſt eagerly, giue themſelues to beleeue lies; doubtleſſe theſe are the times of which <note n="b" place="margin">Greg. apud Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium. expoſ. in 2. ad Theſſal. 2.</note> S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſo liuely diſcourſeth, ſhewing that Antichriſt, and his Miniſters, ſhall work ſo many lying prodigies and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that all which the true Church ſhall doe, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them ſhall ſeeme nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, although this Adoration, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of creatures in this ſort, be moſt inexcuſable, yet more inexcuſeable is their inuocation of the pictures, &amp; croſſe it ſelfe. I doe not heere impute this error, to the learned, who are acquainted, with the figure of <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> taking one
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1880:55"/> perſon for another, and inuocating one, in ſteed of another but in reſpect of the ſimple, and ignorant; for how can they without manifeſt danger of idolatry, vnderſtand that inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Croſſe it ſelfe, (<hi>O crux Aue, &amp;c.</hi>) All haile O Croſſe, the<note n="*" place="margin">In paſſion weeke the croſſe or cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe is the only hope, but at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But there is a praier to be made to the face it ſelfe of Veronica, to the deuout rehearſing of which <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22.

This praier cannot be excuſed by the figure of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopopey</hi> by one perſon being taken for another: for the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is directly made to the corruptible figure; that it would bring the ſuppliant to the incorruptible face.

                  <p>For firſt, he not ſo much as once mentioneth either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice, or tranſubſtantiation, but rather hee expreſly compareth the ſame ſacrifice of bread and wine with the ſacrifices of the olde teſtament, and maketh that the ſame is no more needfull to God then thoſe were. He alſo moſt ſignificantly auoucheth that it is a ſacrifice of the things which are from vs; and hauing made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſeueration, that ſacrifices doe not ſanctifie the man, but that the pure conſcience wherewith the Sacrifice is offered, doth ſanctifie the Sacrifice: hee preſentlie addeth thus, that therefore, the gift of the Church, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a pure ſacrifice, becauſe the Church with ſimplicity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth, it (would he haue ſpoken thus, if Chriſt the Author of all ſanctity, had beene really preſent?) further obſerue, thoſe words of him.</p>
                  <p>This oblation, the Church, onely offereth, pure to the maker, offering to him, with thankeſgiuing, of his Creature: and in the two and thirtieth chapter, hee calleth the oblation, (<hi>primitias, ex ſuis creaturis</hi>) the Primicies of his owne creatures, and there hee further
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1880:70"/> addeth, that God, who giueth vs his gifts, for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Church offereth the firſt fruits, of thoſe gifts; which, (ſaith hee) is the very oblation of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Church receiued from the Apoſtles: and of theſe gifts, in the fiue and thirty Chapter, he ſaith, (<hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena quidem, &amp;c.</hi> the earthly things, which are diſpoſed for vs, it behooueth to be tipes of thoſe things, which are celeſtiall, yet made of the ſame God; and diſputing againſt ſuch Heretikes, who offered of the ſame creatures, of bread and wine, with the Church to God, the Father of Chriſt, and yet denied God the Father of Chriſt to bee the <note place="margin">Curteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obſerue all this diſcourſe clearely and truly gathered out of that Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or for proofe hereof vouchſafe to reade him and for the ſame purpoſe, ſee S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret in Epiſt ad Haebr.</hi>

And in his 32, and 34. hauing clearely ſhewed, that God, rather requireth innocency, and integrity of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then ſacrifice, yet in reſpect of gratitude (ſaith he) not as though God had neede thereof, ſacrifice muſt bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto him: and then addeth theſe words, ſpeaking of the Church, <hi>offerre oportet igitur, &amp;c.</hi> It behooueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to offer to God, the firſt fruits of his creatures; euen as <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſpeaketh, thou ſhalt not appeare empty handed, before the ſight of the Lord thy God, that in thoſe things in which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath been grateful to God; in the ſame things, being ſo deputed, he may receiue that honor which is from him; and it is not the kinde of oblatious which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; oblations were there, and oblations bee heere; ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the people; (to wit the olde Teſtament) and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Church, but the ſpeciall manner, is onely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; becauſe it is now offered, not from ſeruants, but from ſuch as are free. Thus he; and alſo expreſſy, in the firſt lines of this Chapter, he ſaith that therefore, the Church offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a pure ſacrifice, not as though God had need of it, but becauſe, he that offereth the gift, is honoured in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1880:70"/> gift, that is offered, if it bee accepted of. Would hee haue ſpoken thus, if he had beleeued, that Chriſt himſelfe were really preſent, and really offered by the Prieſts hand? nay expreſly, he addeth, that the Church offereth by Chriſt, and by the (<hi>Word</hi>) Chriſt, a pure oblation. By all theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like obſeruations in that learned and holy father, it is euident what maner of oblation he thought the Church had receiued; to wit of Gods creatures, of bread and wine. But the aduerſary, notwithſtanding all theſe euidences, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth vpon theſe words of him: Chriſt taking that, which of a creature is bread, ſaid, this is my body, and the Chalice, which is of that creature, which is according to vs; confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, to be his blood: theſe be the words, vpon which they inſiſt: which may ſeeme to make ſome what for the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> Conſubſtantiation, but nothing at all, for the tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiaters. Tell me O Chriſtian, did Chriſt in verity, make the creatures of bread and wine, which are according to vs, to be his body, and bloud? that implieth contradiction, and is of thoſe things which cannot be done; (as the Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelues will confeſſe) but tell me O Chriſtian? did not Chriſt, when he ſaid, bread was his body, and wine was his blood? did he not inſtitute a Sacrament? it is cleare. Who wil not therefore thus inferre? that bread muſt be his body, and wine, muſt be his blood, in that manner, in which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are called, and ſaid, to be the very things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they are Sacraments, to wit, Sacramentally, in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, operation, efficacy. Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> meaneth (as it is moſt cleare) that naturall bread, and naturall wine (which are the things offered, as hee moſt often, and ſignificantly affirmeth) Chriſt, confeſſed to be his body, and his bloud; the which becauſe they can not be truly, and really, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out implying of contradiction, or without deſtruction of the creatures; (which he moſt clearly denieth, and is moſt euidently, againſt all, the whole diſcourſe of that Father,) they muſt bee therefore the body, and bloud of Chriſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, according to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Doctour was much delighted with viſions in his life time, and therefore I will now for his ſake ſet one downe for the Dowiſts to demurre vpon it. There was a great controuerſie betwixt the Pope and his Cardinals, (as a <note n="f" place="margin">Pius. 2. hiſt. Bohem. cap. 13.</note> Pope relateth) whether the Morauians and the Ruſſians conuerted to the Chriſtian faith, by <hi>Ciril,</hi> ſhould be permitted to haue the publike Lyturgie, and ſeruice in their knowne tongue or not. Their Apoſtle <hi>Ciril</hi> was earneſt for it, with ſome of the Cardinals: others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it, which contradiction miraculouſly was checked with a voice heard from heauen, ſpeaking thus to them; Let euerie ſpirit praiſe the Lord, and euerie tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him: and ſo the Pope with his Cardinals were by the Angelicall viſion, inſtructed how to vnderſtand thoſe Scriptures by the Angell cited, and therupon gaue way to <hi>Cirils</hi> requeſt; that the Morauians &amp; Ruſſians ſhould haue their publike ſeruice in their own tongue, which they haue to this day: wherein they doubtleſſe find ſuch a comfort, that by no meanes they will relinquiſh that holy vſe, though ſome haue often attempted againſt it. I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued how ſince the Engliſh Pontificians haue had their Primers ſet forth both in Engliſh and Latine together, that they do farre more willingly, and more deuoutly read their prayers in the Engliſh tongue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Latin: proteſting that they receiue far greater comfort thereby; wiſhing alſo that the publike Church-ſeruice might to their like comfort be propoſed in that tongue which they vnderſtood. Before God of his mercy, firſt touched my hart to liſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, I would ſometimes out of a contemptuous kind of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie (where I was not knowne) heare a peece of a Sermon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1880:83"/> in ſome of the Engliſh Churches heere in London: but by no means wold I ſtay or liſten to the hearing of the ſinging of their Pſalms, (for I did both loath and deteſt them) but when God vouchſafed to touch my heart, firſt with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Romane abuſes, both for doctrine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, I began ſometimes to commune with my ſelfe, whether perhaps, the Engliſh Church Lyturgie were not calumniated? Whereupon I would ſometimes more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately, and (where I was not to be knowne) begin to giue more carefull, liſtening vnto the Engliſh Preachers, and alſo moſt curiouſly obſerue the manner of the ſinging in the Churches: both which at very firſt me thought were performed with that ſimplicitie, integritie, and grauitie, that I began to thinke thus: perhaps God is amongſt them; but when vpon often, and further more curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, I found that all their ſeruice (except ſome few prayers, and thoſe verie holy alſo) was compoſed out of the infallible word of God, his holy Scriptures: I reſolued that the ſame muſt needs be good, if no eſſential part of ſeruice, were otherwiſe wanting. And when I found alſo that the Preachers continually did inculcate to their Auditors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of conſcience, and holineſſe of conuerſation with neceſſitie of good works, and of that faith which <note n="g" place="margin">Ad Galat. 5.</note> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by charitie to ſaluation: I well and clearely perceiued how the Church of England was moſt egregiouſly calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated by the Romane Doctors. And when I found alſo the miniſtration of the two principalleſt, (and ſingularly ſo termed) Sacraments: to wit Baptiſme, and the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſo ſincerely and Euangelically, and ſo voide of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, miniſtred in their Churches, and withall found that Confirmation, Penance, Marriage, Orders, Viſitation of the ſicke, were for the ſubſtances thereof, religiouſly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their Churches, I was not a little edified. But that which moſt edified me, was to obſerue, how in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Lyturgies, their minds ſeemed to me, (or at leſt that they might) to concurre ioyntly with their tongues, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1880:84"/> with their religious and pious ſounds, to beate the gates of heauen, and begge mercie at his handes onely: whom, with the moſt bleſſed Father, and the holy Ghoſt, I ſaw onely worſhipped with diuine worſhip in their Churches. And although I wanted in ſome ſewer that lowly, humble, and religious carriage, which the place, the manner of prayers, and aſſembly required; eſpecially in ſome of the young ſort: yet in the miniſters themſelues, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones with many aged men, and others of riper yeares, I ſaw them often kneeling with great deuotion and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my great edification. There I obſerued not that drowſie oſcitancie, leaning, and yawning, which is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the papiſticall Churches, yea euen amongſt the <note n="h" place="margin">Bern. in coena Domini. cap. 3.</note> religious Monkes. There I obſerued not the impudent and ſhameleſſe attendings, courtings and obſeruings of fine dames within their Churches, the which how intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable it is in the papiſticall Churches, eſpecially in Italy and at Rome it ſelfe, I referre to the iudgement of all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent trauailers: doubtleſſe their Churches there be ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, with <note n="i" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> adulterous, laſciuious, wanton, and inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eyes. Obſeruing theſe things: O how happy thought I, art thou O England, if as thou enioyeſt the light of Chriſts Goſpell, ſo alſo thou wouldeſt more and more by holy and pure conuerſation, labour to excell the Churches of Sodoma, and Gomorha, where all impure Idolatry, and abhominations doe reigne? Heere I obſerued alſo, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God euer commended. Faith, Hope, and Loue in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, inceſſantly inculcated, the Fathers of the ancient Church reuerently cited, the memories of the moſt bleſſed Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> and Chriſts Apoſtles reuerenced and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yea in their publike Prayers, and Sermons their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and noble acts, preached, commended, inculcated, to be followed, and imitated: The buriall of the dead, verie religious and pious, and altogether Apoſtolicall: which obſeruing, me thought theſe men ſure doe ſtriue onely for truth, reiecting all vncertaine traditions. And then with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1880:84"/> all I could not, but inwardly be moued in my verie ſoule, againſt <hi>Stapleton, Sanders, Allen, Parſons, Bellarmine,</hi> and other like Pontificians, for their horrible calumniations, againſt the Church of England, and the gouernment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as though they buried their dead like dogs; perſwaded not their people to good life, but onely to faith; that they miniſtred their Sacraments, very irreligiouſly, with ſuch like imputations, all which I found to be meere calumniations. And I found the ſame Church ſo Apoſtolicall, ſo Chriſtian, that me thought I ſaw the very Primitiue faith, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Apoſtles, and the verie rites of their Church to be in it obſerued. And in theſe obſeruations I began more inwardly to be moued, becauſe as my knowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to allow of the Church of England, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the Romane hereſies and abuſes increaſed: ſo alſo my ſoule increaſed in the loue of God, deteſtation of ſinne, and auoiding the occaſions of ſinne, the loathing of this life, and an earneſt deſiring to be with Chriſt: whom (ſince my renouncing of Papiſtrie,) with the Father, and holy Ghoſt (as my ſoule, euidently teſtifieth vnto me) I do moſt ſincerely loue and eſteeme aboue all things in this world, and ſo fully with my whole ſoule &amp; heart, that me thought I could comfortably and confidently ſay vnto it with the words of the holy Prophet, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 114.</note> (<hi>conuertere, &amp;c.</hi>) my ſoule be couerted into thy reſt, for the Lord hath done well to thee.

For ſome one of their Prieſts in euery Church receiuing and offering of Chriſt (onely vnder the forme of bread) doth not with them offer a perfect and proper ſacrifice: Chriſt, forſooth, muſt bee vnder both kindes, elſe hee is not a perfect and proper Sacrifice, according to the<note n="k" place="margin">

                     <hi>Platina</hi> reports him, that as there were many reaſons, to forbid Prieſts marriage, ſo there were more to allow them mariage: how many there are, hee that will reade <note n="h" place="margin">Pelagius de planctu.</note>

                     <hi>Nicholas Clemangis,</hi> will eaſily acknowledge: and the Verdict of that Pope to haue beene moſt iuſt, and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude this matter it is as cleere as the Heauens that the Pontificians are fauourers of al impudicity in their Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by forbidding them marriage, and yet permitting them to eate, drinke, and conuerſe as indifferently as the married doe. So are they alſo in many other caſes, Authors, and Abetters of much Impurity: and heer I obſerue, by the way (I know not by what ſecret ſpirit it comes to paſſe) that our Engliſh Ghoſtly Fathers, are for moſt part, eaſie inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters and abſoluers in caſe of moſt impure ſinnes, but if a man diſobey a Popes breefe, none or elſe very difficult is their abſolution. A crooked deformed Prieſt, would not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1880:96"/> a Prieſt forſooth, allowing the oath of Allegeance; and that Ignatian who denied me abſolution, for that I held the Pope, had not authority to depoſe Princes, yet could he abſolue the Maſter of the houſe, who was more then thought to haunt common queanes, himſelfe alſo not vnacquainted with the notoriouſneſſe thereof. Hee was iuſt another Peere Cotton. God vouchſafe, to open the eies of the ſeduced, to leaue the ſociety of that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath ſo ſhamefully Apoſtated from Ieſus Chriſt his ſacred doctrines and moſt holy inſtitutions, and hath thus repleated her congregations with all nefarious impurities.</p>
                  <p>Sundry other Lawes there are, which might iuſtly bee called in queſtion: and whoſoeuer will with indifferent eye conſider all ſuch lawes and cuſtomes wherein the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, doe moſt differ from the reformed Churches, hee ſhall find that they al haue expreſſe reſpect to ſet vp the Romane Monarchy; either in Temporals or Spiritualls: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Law and Cuſtome wherewith they endeuor to exempt from all correction of Ciuill Magiſtrates all Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men, though their offences bee enormious and ſuch as cry for vengeance from Heauen. Like is their Law of reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing certaine Papall Caſes, which cauſeth many ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſsions: like is their Law and Cuſtome for their Penitents to confeſſe an intire number of all their ſinnes with the Circumſtances therof (changing the nature of ſin) which cauſeth inexpreſsible conflicts and ſcruples, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in conſciences of their Women Recuſants.

                  <hi>England</hi> as many currants, as ſtood him in fiue hundred pounds; by that meanes, to conuey ſome letters, into the ſame Kingdome: (doubtleſſe, thoſe letters carried ſome myſterie with them, that were ſo cloſelie and with ſuch great care to bee carried.) But the practicall ſpirit of that man, and his ſolicitudes for <hi>England,</hi> are to well known, therefore, of him ynough. But one word with the Corrector, who iumpe at the time, when the damnable Powdertreaſon ſhould haue been acted, came downe from Rome, and in the company of ſome fiue or ſixe Ignatians, (a matter not vſuall to haue ſo many Ignatians ſent together in one miſſion for <hi>England</hi>) appointed and purpoſed with all expedition, to paſſe for <hi>England:</hi> but ſo ſoone as they vnderſtood, of the diſcouerie of the powder plot, they all, and this Corrector, alſo, changed their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſetled themſelues elſewhere, one of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleſt of them now playing the Rector at S.

For my part, I will not iudge any certainetie, onely I obſerue, howe in that moſt helliſh attempt, when <note n="i" place="margin">Apoc. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Abaddon,</hi> with his ſmoakie Locuſts, would haue blowen vp together all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this kingdom; there were none but Ignatians, as <hi>Garnet, Gerard, Holcorne, Teſmond:</hi> or Ignatianed, as <hi>Catesby, Rookewood &amp;c.</hi> (who loued the Fathers ſo dearly, that they eſteemed of none, who did not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuerence the Fathers) were to bee found, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or abettors of that helliſh attempt; and yet the Ignatians, and their friends beyond ſeas, what with

O immortall God of heauen! how hath the God of this world, blinded their eies! that they will poſt vppe and downe, the ſtrawie face of that wretched ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? they doubtles here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are delighted with counterfeits, and a maske of ſtraw prouided for the fire with the worſhippers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Here, if I may be ſo bold, I would aske of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Doway, (becauſe he is a ſpeciall chieftaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) what ſpirit might bee obſerued to haue been in him, when hee, with more then ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, entertained <hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> the Powder-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſome diuers whole daies together, before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>England,</hi> with much conference with him; not without admiration of diuers of the Colledge, (who knew not the miſtery) conſidering the meannes of the man. Surely if the <note n="k" place="margin">D. N.</note> Vice-preſident had been there then, who cried auengance on a certaine Soueraigne, when he was for his clemency commended by a true hearted Engliſh Prieſt: hee had been a fit man to haue been of the Councell. But I maruell, not at his curſing ſpirit, for he came from the Campe, to the Seminaries, and of a ſouldier, quickly (which in ancient times would not haue been ſo commendable) was made a Prieſt. But alas
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1880:101"/> to make an end of this matter, that the Ignatians, and the Ignatianed, were too too well acquainted with ſome great matter to be acted about the Powder time. For when I was laſt beyond the ſeas, a graue perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in my hearing, and in the hearing of a reuerend Prieſt, that the<note n="l" place="margin">R.

But I ſurceaſe to write any more of this kind, I haue perpaps diſcouered ſo much of the Ignatian ſpirit, that ſome of them will attempt by ſome meanes or other, to attenuat my ſpirit: but I weigh it not, for nothing more welcome to me then death it ſelf, ſo that I may be found prouided, and ready to meet him and to be with him, after whom my ſoule longeth and breatheth ſo much, as this corruptible fleſh of mine will permit me.

And I humbly wiſh the Engliſh Recuſants to beware of ſuch ſeducers, as come vnder the garments of ſheepe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly are rauening wolues, who plotting to bring to paſſe their conuerſion of <hi>England,</hi> ſeeke nothing but the ſubuerſion thereof, rather then their deſires ſhould not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1880:101"/> take effect. And therefore, as themſelues well know, are euer inculcating matters, to the diſgrace of the Church, and ſtate-gouernment of this Kingdome; &amp; cannot well indure, that any Prieſt in his Sermons, ſhould ſo much as commend and inculcate obedience to temporall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. I my ſelfe was at my firſt comming ſixteene yeeres ſince into this Kingdome, not a little reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two Ignatian Prieſts, becauſe vpon that text, <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 22: Marke 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue vnto God that which is Gods, and to Caeſar that which is Caeſars;</hi> I had (ſaid they) too much inſiſted vpon the latter part thereof, in perſwading of obedience to the temporal magiſtrate, and yet in that ſermon (which was not aboue an houre and halfe long, I am aſſured) I diſcourſed not twenty lines of that ſubiect.</p>
               <p>To proceed, I gather another tricke of naughty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, eſpecially in the elder and latter Pontifician Monkes and Friers, who haue ſet forth ſo many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet and comentitious treatiſes, in the ancient Fathers names, by that meanes to eſtabliſh and confirme their doctrines, of their tranſubſtantiation, their Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, their confiding in merits of Saints, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images, &amp;c. Wherein, I do conſtantly affirme, that the moſt pregnant, and cleareſt proofes, which they pretend for moſt of their Romane poſitions, are taken out, either of ſuch counterfeit bookes, as ſome of the learnedſt Pontificians call in queſtion; or elſe out of ſuch commentitious bookes, and putatiue workes, of ancient Fathers; which by very ſufficient proofe, may bee ſhewed, to bee not currant. And when withall, I obſerue, what order they haue taken with their <note n="*" place="margin">Indices expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torij, Romanus, Neapolitanus Hiſpanus, Belgicus editià Povtificijs.</note> Expurgatory Indices; not onely, to giue annotations, but further to corrupt the very texts of Authours; ſo that none, of later Pontifician Authors, in ſhort time (ſuch as <hi>Caietane, Ferus, Stella, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicus Granatenſis, Polidore Virgill, Claudius Eſpex. &amp;c.</hi>) ſhall bee found ſound, and to ſpeake like
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1880:102"/> themſelues: yea, they ſticke not to corrupt, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry texts of ancient Fathers, whoſe editions they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie innouate at <hi>Rome, Paris, Lions, &amp;c.</hi> The indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <note n="*" place="margin">His Treatiſe of corruption of Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councels, by the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</note> M. <hi>Thomas James,</hi> hath produced many of ſuch corruptions, and promiſeth much more; one of them for a taſt, which I alſo obſerued long agoe, and propoſed to a learned man, but receiued no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I will heere giue to the Reader: it is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, of a ſaying of S. <hi>Gregorie Niſſene,</hi> which is this, (<hi>Illam ſolummodo naturam, quae increata eſt, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere, ac venerari didicimus:</hi>) were haue learned, onely to worſhip, and adore, that nature which is increate: but the Spaniſh Expurgatorie Indices, ſay, the word (onelie) muſt bee put out of the text: a good cauſe why; the reader, cannot but obſerue the myſterie; therefore I paſſe it, with ſilence. Doubtleſſe theſe men, who are ſo impudent, to ſet foorth their owne late Authours otherwiſe, then themſelues wrote; and are not aſhamed, to corrupt the texts of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers workes: it is no maruell, that they do ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in their ranſlations, peruert the ſacred word, abhorring nothing more, then in thoſe places of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, in which they diſſent, from the reformed Churches, to haue their tranſlations reformed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the originalls of ſacred Scripture, in which the word of God was firſt written, by the Authours thereof. Many ſhifts <note n="p" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 2. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Further, the naughty ſpirits of many Pontificians, as <hi>Bellarmine, Stapleton, &amp;c.</hi> haue ſeemed manifeſt to me, in that they doe, moſt egregiouſly (to bring, the

As firſt, they accuſe them, that they, giue iuſtification to faith onely, (meaning oſtentimes, ſuch a naked faith, as they teach void of charity, that is, faith informed, as they ſpeake) a mere calumniation. For, who knoweth not, that the reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches make iuſtifying faith, that, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably <note n="p" place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> worketh by charitie, as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth? againe, they are accuſed, to exclude, neceſſity of good works to ſaluation, and all reward alſo, of good workes at ſaluation: meere imputations. For, as they continually inculcate, and commend neceſſity of good works in their pulpits, more effectually, then, in many of the Pontifician Churches (whoſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, are much buſied, with extolling the merits of Saints, the worth of indulgences, &amp;c.) So likewiſe, they publikehe profeſſe that God, will not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of the leaſt good worke (done, as it ought for his ſake,) to reward the ſame. They are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calumniated, (amongſt the good Engliſh Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who meane well) that thy make Gods he Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, and impeller of, and to ſinne: a meere calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation.

But I haue often wondered, why the ſpeciall abſurdities and abuſes (if there be ſo many in the Booke of Engliſh Common Praier, as they pretend) haue not been by any of the aduerſaries in ſome ſpecial ſort largely diſcouered and confuted, conſidering how often, and in how ſpeciall ſort, the many turpitudes, abuſes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions &amp; fooleries of their Roman Maſſes haue been learnedly deciphered.</p>
               <p>Commonly, and daily, is the Church of <hi>England</hi> calumniated, for giuing vnto the Prince, the Title of Supreame head or gouernor of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which yet is giuen in no other ſenſe, then to ſhew that very power and Supreame Iuriſdiction which all Ancient Chriſtian Emperours and Kings

But touching the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments, giuing of Orders, giuing the power of the Keies, and in or touching defining of faith; it is a meere foppery, to ſay, the Prince challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth any ſuch matter in this Kingdome, or that any ſuch is giuen him.

O prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrin, it is not enough, ſay theſe men to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be vnited with Chriſt, and ſubiected to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Paſtors, who are in vnion, with the whole Catholike Church, touching the Catholike faith; vnleſſe we be alſo vnited, by immediate ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1880:105"/> the Pope of Rome; who may both be an Heretike, and alſo, contaminate the Church, with his pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lawes: So that if a Pope Nerolike, (as <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8.) would by pernicious Lawes, draw you from Chriſt; and like as a Heliogabalus (as <hi>Iohn</hi> the 12.) would draw you to all impurities, and teach you to diuide the Church, by oppoſing, againſt the true Pope, after his iuſt depoſition by the whole Romane Clergy, &amp; moſt Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> aſſembled in a Synod: or Ottomanlike (as <hi>Paul</hi> the 5.) will teach you, againſt Chriſts inſtitution, not to yeelde temporall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to your lawfull Soueraigne; if hee out of his throne, take vpon him, to dethrone him: vnleſſe forſooth, you be ſubiect to ſuch Vicars of Chriſt, you cannot haue ſaluation in Chriſt. O prodigious and vaine Doctrine! of theſe times the holy Prophets (O ye Britaines) haue forewarned vs, let vs beware of them.</p>
               <p>What vile calumniation is that by which the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches of England, are charged, to deny the ſeeing of Gods face and glory, vnto the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vntill the day of Iudgement? What a ſlander, that ſhe reſpects no Holy daies of Chriſt, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? I dare ſay, that the memories of the Apoſtles, are in many places, of this Kingdome as religiouſly obſerued, as the Sundaies are with them: but in the obſeruation of the Sabbath, our Lords day; the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth, ſo farre ſurpaſſe all Papiſtical Churches, yea of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, that it were a ſinne to make any compariſon therein betwixt them. <note n="a" place="margin">Caluino Turciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note>
